# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Project Overview

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game can be played in a terminal or a graphical user interface (GUI), depending on the implementation, by two players taking turns. The objective is to be the first to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode:** Play against another person.
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Players can easily select their moves using either a command-line interface or a graphical interface.
- **Win Detection:** The game automatically detects and announces when a player wins or if the game ends in a draw.
- **Board Display:** The game board is displayed after each move, showing the current state of play.
